# Adapt-To-Write
Writing tool to assist students with special needs.

A hollow 3D printed casing with 3 parts, top cap, pen body and bottom cap, are to be assembled. This design allows the writing tool to fit exactly in the case. The extra weight from the case allows the student to draw darker lines and increase its visibility. At the same time, the casing also widens the pen, improving the student's grip on it.
